    1. PRIMARY VALIDATION (Constituency Level):
       - Download End Child Poverty data (two-child limit %)
       - Download DWP Children in Low Income Families data
       - Correlate with project's constituency.csv data
       - Expected: r > 0.6 correlation

    2. BUDGETARY VALIDATION (National Level):
       - Compare project budgetary_impact.csv with OBR costings
       - Check obr_comparison.csv for pre-extracted comparisons
       - Expected: Within 30% of OBR estimates

    3. POVERTY IMPACT VALIDATION:
       - Compare project metrics.csv poverty_change figures
       - Cross-reference with IFS/Resolution Foundation estimates
       - Expected: 0.5-1.0pp reduction in child poverty

    4. REGIONAL VALIDATION:
       - Check regional patterns match DWP regional data
       - West Midlands and North West should show highest impact
       - Scotland should show lower impact (Scottish Child Payment)

    Run the validation script:
        uv run python scripts/validate_constituency_data.py
